        2: "There are few words I know to describe the way I feel.  They should have sent a poet.",
        3: 'Every day that passes, I find that I love you more and more.',
        4: 'I would go through all nine circles of hell and back for you.  Treachery would be difficult, but doable.',
        5: "It's hard to get you out of my mind; just like that damned Havana song.",
        6: "You've caught my eye like a Chinese Finger Trap catches my fingers, Valentine!",
        7: "I am every bit yours, just as you are every bit mine.",
        8: "You make every bad day worth every moment.",

        15: "I'm so happy when we can watch horrible things together.",
        16: "I so often wish we could just freeze time together.",
        17: "If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right.",
        18: "It's hard to believe we became such a perfect pairing.",
        19: "If you were a library rental I'd get the shit fined out of me for not returning you.",
        20: "I will always be here for you; physically or otherwise.",
        21: "I hope your day is as nice as your boobs, Valentine.",
        22: "You are my center, my strength, my motivation.  Don't ever stop.",
        23: "You're the best partner in crime a dope like me could ask for.",
        24: "Roses aren't a good symbol of our love.  Roses wilt and don't last.  Our love is more like a GameBoy; lasts even through a bomb blast.",
        25: "You're at work while I'm writing these.  Please come back soon.",
        26: "You grew on me like E.Coli grew on Chipotle's veggies!",
        27: "If you were The Thing you could assimilate me anytime.",

        33: "You are my happy place.",
        34: "I'm so glad we're one of those couples that won't settle on a dumb ass baby name.",
        35: "If I had a nickel for every time I think of you, I'd have a nickel, cause you never leave my mind.",
        36: "Every day I wake up next to you becomes even more worth it than the last.",
        37: "It's only been 834 days for us.  Let's bump that up by a few thousand.",
        38: "You are my home.  Wherever we are, I'm content.",
        39: "I'm not sure that I knew who I was before I met you.",
        40: "For pulling me out of myself, I can never repay you.  I owe you my life, my love, and my continued faith in myself and in us.",
